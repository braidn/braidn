# Hey-Oh!

I am caught and seemingly have been for the past 8 years in the dry cycle of e-commerce.
This means I noodle on inventory systems, SKUs, back-end API's, and so much more... Probably.
Outside of that (but, still in computing),
I love to build small/replaceable things,
fiddle with infrastructure and container images,
push serverless functions to their maximum RPC nature,
and explore the boundaries of type systems.

My physical loves are keyboards, bags, and prime camera lenses... OH! the most important thing:
_I am open to new roles_ in Infrastructure, Devops and FullStack Engineering.
If you want to discuss anything, <a rel="me" href="https://ruby.social/@braidn">toot into my dm's on Mastodon</a>.
They are always open.
You can also [ask me just about anything on GitHub][ama] if you prefer to interact in an async manner.
