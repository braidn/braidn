# Velcome!

I am caught and seemingly have been for the past 8 years in the dry cycle of e-commerce.
This means I noodle a lot on inventory systems, skus, back-end dev, and the works... Probably.
Outside of that (but, still in computing),
I am love to build small/replacable things,
fiddle with docker images,
and push the boundaries of type systems.

My physical loves are keyboards and prime camera lenses... OH!
I also work at wonderful beauty startup called [Glossier][glos].
If you want to discuss anything, [my dm's on Twitter][twit] are always open.
You can also [ask me just about anything][ama] if you prefer more space to interact (>280 chars)
