# Hey-Oh!

For the past 20ish years, I’ve been happily stuck in the gears of finance and e‑commerce: inventory models, SKUs, and the APIs that make them go. I like small, composable tools, tidy container images, and serverless functions that behave like finely tuned RPC endpoints. I’m also the person who gets a little too excited about type systems.
IRL, I collect keyboards, obsess over bags, and shoot with prime lenses.
