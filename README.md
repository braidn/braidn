# Hey-Oh!

I am caught and seemingly have been for the past 8 years in the dry cycle of e-commerce.
This means I noodle a lot on inventory systems, skus, back-end api's, and so much more... Probably.
Outside of that (but, still in computing),
I love to build small/replaceable things,
fiddle with Docker/container images,
push serverless bits to their maximum RPC nature,
and explore the boundaries of type systems.

My physical loves are keyboards, bags, and prime camera lenses... OH! the most important thing:
_I am open to new roles_ in Infrastructure, Devops and Backend Engineering.
If you want to discuss anything, <a rel="me" href="https://ruby.social/@braidn">toot into my dm's on Mastodon</a>.
They are always open.
You can also [ask me just about anything on GitHub][ama] if you prefer more space to interact (>280 chars)
