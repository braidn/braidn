# Velcome!

I am caught and seemingly have been for the past 8 years in the dry cycle of e-commerce.
This means I noodle a lot on inventory systems, skus, back-end api's, and so much more... Probably.
Outside of that (but, still in computing),
I love to build small/replaceable things,
fiddle with Docker/container images,
push serverless bits to their maximum RPC nature,
and explore the boundaries of type systems.

My physical loves are keyboards and prime camera lenses... OH!
I also work at a wonderful beauty startup named [Glossier][glos] (pronounced Gloss-ee-eh).
If you want to discuss anything, [my dm's on Twitter][twit] are always open.
You can also [ask me just about anything][ama] if you prefer more space to interact (>280 chars)
